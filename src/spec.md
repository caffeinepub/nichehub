# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Implement a high-definition video player with preview thumbnails for the Media Gallery.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace current video playback with an HD video player component that supports .mp4 and 4K resolution
- Add standard playback controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen, seek bar) to the video player
- Generate and display preview thumbnail images for every video in the gallery
- Ensure thumbnails appear in both the MediaLibrary grid view and calendar sidebar

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click on any video to open it in a high-definition player with full controls, and can see preview thumbnails for all videos before clicking them.
