  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive debugging and logging for the video upload functionality across frontend (VideoUpload.tsx, useQueries.ts, thumbnailGenerator.ts) and backend (main.mo). The changes add detailed console logging at every step of the upload process, error handling with user-facing toast notifications, and progress tracking through the ExternalBlob upload mechanism. All four requirements (REQ-29 through REQ-32) are addressed with evidence of debugging improvements, error logging, and proper parameter handling.",
