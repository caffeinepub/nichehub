  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to the VideoUpload component that correctly implement authentication state checking and conditional UI rendering. The component now uses the identity object to determine authentication state and conditionally shows either the login prompt or the upload interface. The login function is only called when the user is not authenticated, preventing duplicate login invocation errors.",
